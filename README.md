# Spring Boot Shopping Cart Using Microservices Architecture

## About

This is a shopping cart built using Microservices architecture. The idea was to build some basic features into the shopping cart.

It was made using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Data JPA**, **Spring Data REST**, **Docker**, **Eureka** and **Hystrix**.
Database - **H2** (in memory).

**UserService** - To add an user, delete an user, fetch an user and fetch all users.

**ProductService** - To add a product, delete a product, fetch a product and fetch all products.

**CartService** - To add products to the cart, delete the cart and view all carts.

**OrderService** - For placing orders and viewing an order.

Flow:
**Controller --> Service --> Repository**

Very basic schema was used for the shopping cart. 
Database per service model has been followed as a part of Miscroservices Architecture.

Hystrix was showcased only in order service just for example. 
Eureka has been used in the shopping cart.
**Postman** was used for testing. Collection of requests has been attached.
